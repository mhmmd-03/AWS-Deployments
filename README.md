# AWS-Deployments
Proof-of-concept Multi-Tiered AWS Deployments

This repository contains some of the AWS Deployments I have completed over my cloud journey. Most of these were when I was practicing AWS Services to pass the Associate Solution Architect exam.
I successfully passed this certification in August of 2021 and the year prior I had passed the AWS Cloud Practioner Certification. Now I am working towards my AWS Associate Developer certification
